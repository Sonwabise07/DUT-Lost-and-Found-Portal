# DUT Lost & Found Portal

[cite_start]A web-based application developed to provide an efficient and centralized solution for the 33,000 students at the Durban University of Technology (DUT) to report and recover lost belongings.

## Project Role: Lead Programmer

## The Problem

[cite_start]The DUT campus faced a significant challenge with lost and misplaced items. [cite_start]The existing methods, such as unofficial WhatsApp groups and word-of-mouth, were unstructured and inefficient, causing students financial loss and academic disruption. [cite_start]The loss of a student card alone could restrict access to vital university resources like libraries, labs, and exam halls. [cite_start]This project aimed to replace that frustrating process with a structured, transparent, and reliable system.

## Key Features

This application was designed and built with a focus on solving the core problems faced by students:

-   [cite_start]**Secure User Registration & Login:** Students create accounts using their DUT credentials for a secure, verified platform.
-   [cite_start]**Lost & Found Item Reporting:** Users can easily report a lost or found item by filling out a detailed form, including its name, category, last known location, a description, and images for clear identification.
-   [cite_start]**Advanced Search & Matching:** A powerful search system allows users to filter items by category, location, or keywords to quickly find potential matches for their lost belongings.
-   **Secure Claim Process:** To prevent fraudulent claims, a user must provide an additional, specific description of the item to verify ownership. [cite_start]Once a claim is verified by the admin, the system facilitates contact between the finder and the owner.
-   [cite_start]**Admin Management:** An administrator dashboard allows for the management of listings and the verification of claims, including updating an item's status from "Lost" to "Found".
-   [cite_start]**User Dashboard:** Each user has a personal dashboard to view recently posted items and track the status of their own reported items.

## My Role & Contributions

As the **Lead Programmer**, I was responsible for:
-   Architecting and developing the backend system using **Python** and the **Flask** micro-framework.
-   Engineering the database schema and integration using **Firebase** to manage user data, item listings, and claims.
-   Implementing the core application logic, including user authentication, the item reporting workflow, and the secure claiming process.
-   Collaborating with the team to translate the project requirements and wireframes into a functional, deployed application.

## System Design

The user flow is designed for simplicity and security, as illustrated in the project's use-case diagram and wireframes.
